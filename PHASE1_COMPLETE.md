# Document Assembly Tool - Phase 1 Complete

## Phase 1 Deliverable: ✅ ACHIEVED
**"Can load survey JSON and display in both Creator and runtime"**

## What's Working

### 1. Multi-Page Architecture ✅
- **Creator Interface:** `http://localhost:3000/creator.html`
- **User Interface:** `http://localhost:3000/` (index.html)
- Both interfaces load independently with shared code bundles

### 2. Survey Loading in Creator ✅
- Survey Designer tab with file loading capabilities
- "Load Sample Survey" button loads `/public/surveys/employment-survey.json`
- Survey structure preview showing pages, elements, and field types
- File upload functionality for custom survey JSON files

### 3. Survey Loading in User Interface ✅
- "Test Survey Loading" button demonstrates runtime survey loading
- Sample survey renders as interactive form with:
  - Text inputs (name, position, salary, start date)
  - Radio buttons (employment type)
  - Form validation
  - Draft saving to localStorage
  - Form submission with data collection

### 4. Technical Foundation ✅
- **TypeScript 5.x** with strict mode and path mapping
- **Vite** build system with multi-entry support
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **ESLint & Prettier** configured
- **File Loading Service** for JSON handling
- **Error Handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Draft Management** using localStorage

## How to Test Phase 1 Deliverable

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Creator Interface:**
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3000/creator.html`
   - Click "Survey Designer" tab
   - Click "Load Sample Survey" to see survey loading in action
   - Upload a custom survey JSON file to test file loading

3. **Test User Interface:**
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3000/`
   - Click "Test Survey Loading" button
   - Fill out the employment survey form
   - Test draft saving and form submission

## Phase 1 Accomplishments

### Core Requirements ✅
1. **Project Setup** - Vite, TypeScript, linting configured
2. **Dependencies** - Survey.js, docxtemplater, file-saver installed
3. **Multi-page Architecture** - Creator and user interfaces working
4. **File Loading System** - JSON loading with error handling
5. **Survey Integration** - Both creator and runtime interfaces
6. **Interface Shells** - Navigation and basic UI complete

### Technical Achievements ✅
- Clean TypeScript architecture with proper typing
- Modular service-based design
- Error handling and loading states
- Draft management system
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, hot reload)

## Ready for Phase 2

The foundation is solid for Phase 2 development:
- **Survey.js Creator** - Full integration ready (service exists)
- **Mapping Interface** - File loading system supports it
- **Package Management** - Configuration system in place
- **Document Generation** - docxtemplater dependency installed
- **UI Framework** - Tailwind CSS and component system ready

## Notes

- Survey.js libraries installed and integrated (some TypeScript warnings normal for Phase 1)
- Sample data in `/public/` folder demonstrates expected file structure
- File loading works with both local files and external URLs
- Draft management persists across browser sessions
- All Phase 1 requirements from PRD Section 10.1 completed

**Phase 1 Status: COMPLETE ✅**  
**Next: Phase 2 - Creator Interface (Weeks 3-4)**
