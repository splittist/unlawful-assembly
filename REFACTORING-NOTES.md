# Creator Main Refactoring

## Overview

The `creator-main.ts` file has been refactored from a monolithic 2,072-line file into a modular architecture with focused, maintainable components.

## Changes Summary

### Before
- **Single file**: `src/creator-main.ts` (2,072 lines)
- All UI logic, event handling, and rendering in one class
- Difficult to maintain, test, and extend

### After
- **Main orchestrator**: `src/creator-main.ts` (156 lines) - 92% reduction!
- **Component modules**: `src/components/creator/` directory with 6 files

## New Component Structure

```
src/components/creator/
├── SurveyDesignerComponent.ts      (193 lines) - Survey creation and editing
├── TemplateManagerComponent.ts      (654 lines) - Template documentation and analysis
├── MappingInterfaceComponent.ts     (607 lines) - Field mapping interface
├── PackageDefinitionComponent.ts    (524 lines) - Package creation and management
├── uiUtils.ts                       (50 lines)  - Shared UI utilities
└── index.ts                         (12 lines)  - Module exports
```

## Component Responsibilities

### SurveyDesignerComponent
- Renders the Survey.js creator interface
- Handles survey creation, loading, and editing
- Manages preview and download functionality
- Sample survey loading

### TemplateManagerComponent
- Displays DOCX template syntax documentation
- Handles template file upload and parsing
- Shows placeholder analysis and validation
- Export placeholder lists

### MappingInterfaceComponent
- Renders the field mapping interface
- Manages drag-and-drop field mapping
- Auto-mapping suggestions
- Mapping validation and statistics
- Import/export mappings

### PackageDefinitionComponent
- Package metadata form
- Package validation
- Import survey and mappings from other tabs
- Export complete packages

### uiUtils.ts
- Shared notification system (`showNotification`)
- Type color utilities (`getTypeColor`)
- Other common UI helpers

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each component is focused on a single responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Components can be reused or composed differently
4. **Readability**: Smaller files are easier to understand
5. **Scalability**: New features can be added to specific components
6. **Future-ready**: Prepared for further UI component refactoring

## Architecture

The main `CreatorApp` class now acts as an orchestrator:
- Initializes services (FieldMappingService, SurveyCreatorService)
- Creates component instances
- Handles navigation between tabs
- Delegates rendering to components

## Migration Notes

- All functionality preserved from original implementation
- No breaking changes to the public API
- Services remain unchanged
- Imports consolidated using barrel exports (index.ts)

## Next Steps

Future refactoring opportunities:
1. Extract common UI patterns into reusable components
2. Add TypeScript interfaces for component props
3. Consider state management patterns for cross-component communication
4. Add unit tests for individual components
5. Extract tab navigation into its own component
